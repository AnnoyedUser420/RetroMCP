**MCP**

* Automatically download Minecraft .jar's from official download links
* Include an auto patching bat to create patched client and server jars
* An Eclipse Start class for applet-only versions
* Reobfuscation for all available versions

# Licensing

MCP Version 4.3 __did not__ ship with a license, therefore it is allowed to be reuploaded and modified here.
